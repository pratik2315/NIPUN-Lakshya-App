# Data

The NL app collects different kinds of data including student assessment data, list of schools available in the districts, mentors data, competency mapping etc.

If we consider data collected from a student, the NL app does not collect any personal data of any students. Instead data is collected from assessments conducted through the application. Such as:

- Data collected while using the application
- The grade & subject selected for assessment
- Performance on questions tested
- Score cards
- Final performance of a student is also recorded

The data is captured through the ODK forms, when the students submit the answers the data is captured and stored in the server.

The data is also collected from various schools such as:
- Name of the educational institute
- District
- UDISE Code
- Block type etc. 

This data is then used to show the list of schools and their spot assessment score on the Nipun lakshya dashboard.
